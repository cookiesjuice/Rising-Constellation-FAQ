### How does experience enhance fleets? How much experience per level?
+0.5% of main stats per lvl
(att, def etc..)
and more moral, so less likely to flee when other squads are killed. XP is not flat by lvl but exponential, like agent xp

### Is there a place I can find out what the ship stats do? like what is maneuverability, and the difference between energy and explosive attack, etc?
Battle simulator in the game is the best source of information
energy attack is reduced by shield, and explosive can be blocked by flock

### Can we donate ships?
No, only resources
