  Dominions and Autonomous Systems
---
## General
### Do AI controled systems build their own buildings?

They automatically construct buildings over time, very inefficiently. They stop building and upgrading when all of their build slots are full.

### How do I gain control of a Dominion or Autonomous System?
People can flip them to their faction by 2 means:
use Siderians to destabilize and then propaganda them to flip them into dominions
*OR*
Use a navarch with a fleet to conquer it as a system.
Both of these will require an open slot (either as dominion, or system slot)

### Can I use a colony ship to take control of an autonomous system?
No, only conquest or propaganda

### What sectors can I take over an AI controlled system in?
You can only take control of systems in sectors adjacent to one your faction already owns, or in a sector your faction owns.

### Autonomous systems
#### Are they farmable?
yes, Pillaging them is a good way to both level up your agents, and gain resources, repairing buildings is not too hard if someone takes it over. see [Pillaging](/docs/agents/navarch/#pillaging)

### Dominions
#### If I queue a bunch of upgrades in a system and then flip it to domain, does it continue on its happy path?
yes

#### If I develop a system then switch it over to a domain system, does the AI then re-build everything or would it stay optimized to what I have created?
IA can't destroy then rebuild, so it will stay optimized. However, it won't upgrade them all the way (stops when all the slots are taken by a building)

Swapping a system from dominion to system has an increasing ideology cost of +5k each time you flip any system. It is sometimes better to abandon the system and then take control with a siderian, takes more time but has no increasing cost.
