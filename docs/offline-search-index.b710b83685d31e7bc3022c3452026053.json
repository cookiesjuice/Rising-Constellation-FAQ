[{"body":"Victory How does one team win? There are 3 paths to victory. Each path gives 2/3/5 stars depending on the goals reached. The goal of the game is to hit the 12 stars mark first as a team.\nMobility What does each point do? it increases credits by .1 per system population . When received from a building in a system, it increases the mobility in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.\nOther impacts Mobility is a scaling factor for two late-game buildings: reflect district and business arch. They are generally considered some of the best late game credit generation buildings.\nStability When received from a building in a system, it increases the stability in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.\nFactor’s into growth speed, as you approach 0 stability, or negative values, growth will be hindered.\nWhen below 0, penalties to the system production will occur View the 3rd tab on the system to view specific values:\nWhat exactly does SLSD do? SLSD is like radar? It shows enemy fleet movement in range. Higher SLSD means the radius is larger.\nResources How fast do resources accumulate? The number at the bottom of your screen next to each resource show the amount that will be gained every 3 minutes (In Legacy mode). Common practice is to think of at x20 for the amount per hour you will have.\nResource Tax on player trades How long does it take for tax to drop from 60 to 5 not sure anymore.. but like 2% per hour?\nIs there a resource cap?

Each pillage lowers % of resources raided by 45% and it recovers over time by .25% per tick\nConquest Does the time to conquest depend on invasion power? yes slightly depends on defense and invasion power\nHow much invasion power do I need?

If there are more number of jobs available than population, there is a penalty Each building will say how many mobilized workers it requires. For example requires 2 workers to function optimally, the tooltip on the population icon shows how many your buildings require, vs the total number of people in your system, if the mobilized value is greater than the total you will see penalties in your resource production TODO images\nSystem Population How do populations within a system balance between planets? does it every time you have a new pop it tries to even it between all the planets\nColonizing If I am going to colonize, does it matter how far it is from my home world? where to colonize : in early game, to get your second system, it is advised to get one near you to start building on it faster.

You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n\rWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers.  Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git\r  Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

They automatically construct buildings over time, very inefficiently. They stop building and upgrading when all of their build slots are full.\nHow do I gain control of a Dominion or Autonomous System? People can flip them to their faction by 2 means: use Siderians to destabilize and then propaganda them to flip them into dominions OR Use a navarch with a fleet to conquer it as a system. Both of these will require an open slot (either as dominion, or system slot)\nCan I use a colony ship to take control of an autonomous system? No, only conquest or propaganda\nWhat sectors can I take over an AI controlled system in? You can only take control of systems in sectors adjacent to one your faction already owns, or in a sector your faction owns.\nAutonomous systems Are they farmable? yes, Pillaging them is a good way to both level up your agents, and gain resources, repairing buildings is not too hard if someone takes it over. see Pillaging\nDominions If I queue a bunch of upgrades in a system and then flip it to domain, does it continue on its happy path? yes\nIf I develop a system then switch it over to a domain system, does the AI then re-build everything or would it stay optimized to what I have created? IA can’t destroy then rebuild, so it will stay optimized. However, it won’t upgrade them all the way (stops when all the slots are taken by a building)\nSwapping a system from dominion to system has an increasing ideology cost of +5k each time you flip any system.
