  General
  How does one team win? 
  There are 3 paths to victory. Each path gives 2/3/5 stars depending on the goals reached. The goal of the game is to hit the 12 stars mark first as a team.
  
  How fast do resources accumulate?
   Shows the amount that will be gained every 3 minutes (In Legacy mode). Common practice is to think of at x20 for the amount per hour you will have.
  Mobility 
  What does each point do?
  it increases credits by .1 per system population . When received from a building in a system, it increases the mobility in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.
  Other impacts
  Mobility is a scaling factor for two late-game buildings: reflect district and business arch. They are generally considered some of the best late game credit generation buildings.
  Stability 
  When received from a building in a system, it increases the stability in that system only. When received from a Lex, the full value applies to all of your systems.
  
  Factorâ€™s into growth speed, as you approach 0 stability, or negative values, growth will be hindered.
  
  When below 0, penalties to the system production will occur

  Agents
  Market
  Is the agent market the same for everyone?
  Yes, shared among all players in the game.
  How do they gain experience?
  Missions:
  8 to 12 per mission depending on success but if unsuccessful can still earn 2-4 points
  Governor: 1xp per hour
  
  What do they gain when they level?
  One skill point, for descriptions of each skill see:
  Siderian
  Navarch
  Erased
  
  How much do skills like knowledge wisdom and finance increase resource generation in the system?
  5% multiplier for each rank
  
  Favorite faction
  Does an agent's "favorite faction" affect anything?
  not yet.. we want to use it to make easier seduction in certain case, but not implemented yet
  Governor
  If you have a governor in a captured system do they die?
  Goes back to your agent deck
  Actions
  Which actions are instantaneous, vs which ones take time?
  instantaneous actions are : fights / sabotage / assassination / seduction
  Infiltration
  Can I have more than 4 malware in a system?
  Yes, won't give shadow paths points but it will allow to keep the 5 visibility longer if cybersecurity kicks in
  
  Pillaging
  Does the time to pillage depend on bombing power?
  yes slightly depends on defense and bombing power. The base time length for a pillage is 1h
  
  
  
  How much will I get from pillaging?
  One pillage gives 150 ticks of the production of the system for a normal level of success, and 200 ticks for a critical. Each pillage lowers % of resources raided by 45% and it recovers over time by .25% per tick 
  
  General rule is to raid an autonomous system each 8/9 hours if I remember correctly (if you are raiding for resources and not xp)
  
  
  Conquest
  Same for conquest, does it depend on invasion power?
  yes slightly depends on defense and invasion power
  
  How much invasion power do I need?
  Invasion power is compared to system defense, so 
  Navarch Stance
  What is the difference between "Aggressive" and "Fury" for Navarchs?
  same currently
  Recalling
  What happens if you recall a Navarch with a fleet?
  recalling them will destroy the fleet
  
  Erased Removal
  What happens to a fleet if the Navarch is removed by an Erased?
  the Navarch is replaced by a level 0 navarch
  
  Agent Visibility
  If an enemy Siderian is in your system, can you see it?
  Only Erased which are undercover will be hidden, all Siderians, and Navarchs will be visible to enemy players if they are in their system.
  
  Autonomous systems
  Are they farmable? Do people want to flip them so I should avoid pillaging them?
  
  They automatically construct buildings over time, very inefficiently. They stop building and upgrading when all of their build slots are full.
  
   People can flip them to their faction by 2 means:
  use Siderians to destabilize and then propaganda them to flip them into dominions
  OR
  Use a navarch with a fleet to conquer it as a system.
  
  Pillaging them is a good way to both level up your agents, and gain resources, repairing buildings is not too hard if someone takes it over.
  
  Can I use a colony ship to take control of an autonomous system?
  No, only conquest or propoganda
  Dominions
  If I queue a bunch of upgrades and then flip it to domain, does it continue on its happy path?
  yes
  
  If I develop a system then switch it over to a domain system, does the AI then re-build everything or would it stay optimized to what I have created?
  IA can't destroy then rebuild, so it will stay optimized. However, it won't upgrade them all the way (stops when all the slots are taken by a building)
  
  Swapping a system from dominion to system has an increasing ideology cost of +5k each time you flip any system. It is sometimes better to abandon the system and then take control with a siderian, takes more time but has no increasing cost.
  
  Technology 
  Does every patent increase the global cost of all patents regardless of the original cost? (Like a 200 tech patent and a 9,000 tech patent both raise it the same %?)
  yes +50% of their original cost
  Colonizing
  If I am going to colonize, does it matter how far it is from my home world?
  where to colonize : in early game, to get your second system, it is advised to get one near you to start building on it faster. But after that, it always depends on the systems available, the faction strategy,etc
  
  Each faction usually has a chat room dedicated to system reservation to avoid multiple people sending colony ships to the same system and wasting time. Pick a system that looks good to you, and put the NAME XXX:YYY coordinates in the room (these can be found by clicking on the system, 
  
  
  System Production
  
  Most of my time so far is spent waiting for science and ideology points. My production is not working, should I be using it for something?
  
  it's completely normal that the first 2 days you are not capping your production and are waiting on techno and ideo, don't worry.
  
  What is the difference between mobilized and populations?
  If there are more number of jobs available than population, there is a penalty
  Each building will say how many mobilized workers it requires
   for example requires 2 workers to function optimally, 
   the tooltip on the population icon shows how many your buildings require, vs the total number of people in your system, if the mobilized value is greater than the total you will see penalties in your resource production
  
  System Population
  How do populations within a system balance between planets?
  does it every time you have a new pop it tries to even it between all the planets
  
  Ships
  How does experience enhance fleets? How much experience per level?
  +0.5% of main stats per lvl
  (att, def etc..)
  and more moral, so less likely to flee when other squads are killed. XP is not flat by lvl but exponential, like agent xp
  
  Is there a place I can find out what the ship stats do? like what is maneuverability, and the difference between energy and explosive attack, etc?
  Battle simulator in the game is the best source of information
  energy attack is reduced by shield, and explosive can be blocked by flock
  
  Can we donate ships?
  No, only resources
  
  Resource Tax on player trades
  How long does it take for tax to drop from 60 to 5
  not sure anymore..
  but like 2% per hour? 
  
  Is there a resource cap?
  No 
  Per Novae: of course
  
  SLSD 
  What exactly does SLSD do?
  I think SLSD is like radar? It shows enemy fleet movement in range. Higher SLSD means the radius is larger.
  
  Buildings
  Monolith
  Does it scale based on planet or system population?
  It uses the entire system population, you can tell the icon it uses: 
  Strategy - Subjective
  How will the game progress?
  In the early game. Most of the players will try to colonize in order to expand and get more income. Some might play more aggressive by building raid ships but they are not the majority for now.
  Then, in the mid-late game, each people will have to fulfill a role. It is more optimized to specialize into something and exchange for ressources than trying to do everything alone.
  - Warrior : someone who will focus on building ships to raid enemies and conquer them. They need at least 1-2 good production systems and then a mix between techno and credits.
  - Bank : someone who focuses on credits generation to help the warrior(s) handle the maintenance costs. Most of the time, they will search for habitables with a good activity potential and/or build mobility systems in mid-late game.
  - Scientist : someone who focuses on technology production to help everyone research high tier technologies (mostly to rush big ships for the warriors).
  - Ideo : someone who focuses on ideology production to help everyone boost their economy, system limit, etc.
  
  For the 3 last one, some people add a focus on erased or siderian agents, but a lot do a bit of both. And maybe you will find another archetype. 
  
  Teams should decide on what path we should focus to win, and on how they can hinder the other factions. Everything is adaptation at this point.
  
  What should I do?
  First thing first : try to have the patent for the colonization ship to expand. You can look at the different systems of players to have an idea of what is good to build or not in early. Most of the time, systems with 3-4+ planets with a lot of slots / good coefficients are generally good. 
  While doing this, just decide on what you would want to focus on for the faction
